# Lingua Trading Language - Complete Framework

## Overview

Lingua is the comprehensive trading language and framework that forms the foundation of the SM Playbook trading system. This is not meant to be the gospel on how the market works, but rather a systematic grouping of patterns and indicators to help categorize and trade the randomness unfolding in the market at all times.

## Core Principle: Everything is Fractal

The fundamental concept of Lingua is that everything is fractal - the same patterns happen on each timeframe, they just happen at different times. This means our trading approach is seen in the foundation of everything we do.

## Trend Cycles

The baseline approach is the trend cycle. This cycle is how we see all trends at their stage level:

**Complete Cycle:**
```
Consolidation → Breakout/Trendbreak → Uptrend → Extreme Deviation → 
Euphoric Top/Trendbreak → Backside → Backside Reverted → 
Consolidation/Backside Breakout → Repeat
```

### Stage Breakdown

#### 1. Consolidation
- Can go on for extended time periods
- Can happen at many points on the chart
- Sometimes there isn't a clear consolidation, just a trend
- Looking for clear trend forming from high or low

#### 2. Breakout/Trend Break
- Catalyst point of consolidation
- Either breaking trend or breaking out from consolidation
- Can be: break and run, break and retest, or consolidate on trend before running

#### 3. Uptrend
- Confirmed after breaking downtrend or consolidation breakout
- Can move at various speeds
- Main focus: extreme deviations from bottom and top of trend channel
- When extreme points reached → move to next stage

#### 4. Extreme Deviation
- Still in uptrend but reached extreme points
- Alters bias consideration
- Start expecting trend break or euphoric top
- High EV (Expected Value) spot for mean reversion

#### 5. Euphoric Top
- Doesn't happen on every extreme deviation
- Move outside of trend, signified by speed up
- Can be: after-hours runs, pre-market gaps, morning gaps, post-open extensions
- Very high probability mean reversion opportunity
- High EV spot

#### 6. Trend Break
- Key point when uptrend officially turns to backside
- Main trend supporting bottom of channel breaks
- Creates gravity bringing price down

#### 7. Backside
- Reverting to higher timeframe mean
- Indefinite time period
- Unique trading approach based on context

#### 8. Backside Reverted
- Hits higher timeframe mean
- Similar to consolidation approach but with trading opportunities

#### 9. Consolidation/Backside Breakout
- Can continue consolidating or have breakout moves
- Continues until major frontside breakout
- Cycle repeats

## Timeframes

### Main Timeframe Set
- Daily, 4hr, 1h, 15m, 5m, 2m, 1m
- Fractal process - all timeframes provide value

### Bias Process Groupings
- **HTF (High Time Frame)**: Daily, 4hr - Setup identification, main bias, key levels
- **MTF (Mid Time Frame)**: 1hr, 15m - Route start/end, main trend breaks
- **LTF (Low Time Frame)**: 5m, 2m - Execution spots, trade management

### Timeframe Strength Hierarchy
- Higher timeframes normally play bigger role in direction
- Chain of command from highest down
- Different questions answered on different timeframes

### Rough Trading Guide
- **HTF**: Find setups, determine bias, key levels
- **MTF**: Route start/end, main trend breaks, trend/deviation analysis
- **LTF**: Execution hub, entry/exit timing

## Trend Cycle Trade Approaches

### In Consolidation
- Looking for both thesis (fundamental reason to go up)
- High EV spots: dips to means/extremes, main breakouts, break and retests
- Early trend breaks are great sizing spots

### In Uptrend  
- Only long-biased trades
- Two trade types: dips to means or extremes
- Continues until extreme deviation reached

### Extreme Deviation
- Stop looking for longs
- Only euphoric top shorts or trend break shorts
- Most discretionary part of process
- Use deviation band upper as guide
- Extension from various EMAs on daily

### Euphoric Top
- One of best short opportunities
- Catalytic day when shorts take control
- Trade 7:00 AM to 12:00 PM (open-centric)
- Types: Euphoric gap, euphoric extension, partial euphoric

### Trend Break
- Crucial transition from frontside to backside
- Use hourly chart to draw trends
- Want main MTF trend supporting entire upward leg
- Higher in range = better trend break

### Backside
- Look for shorts until main reversion point
- Don't long during this time
- Short means or extremes
- Watch hourly/4hr/daily target areas

### Backside Reverted
- Similar to consolidation approach
- Short bias as still on backside
- Euphoric setups in either direction
- Clear quality trend breaks

## How Trends Interact

### Stair Stepping of Trends
- Higher timeframes hold more weight
- When breaking trend, price goes to next higher timeframe mean
- Resets occur when price goes too far too fast
- All part of unified theory

## Market Structure

Market structure and trend are the same thing. Use market structure to execute and enter/exit trades found on bigger picture trend cycle.

**Core Elements:**
- Sequences of higher highs and higher lows (uptrend)
- Sequences of lower lows and lower highs (downtrend)
- Pivots/structure points for drawing trends and finding risk levels

## Daily Context

Critical for differentiating between various opportunity setups.

### Main Categories
1. **Frontside**: At all-time highs in this move
2. **Backside**: Not at all-time highs, below previous swing high
3. **IPO**: Initial public offerings

### Daily Molds

#### Daily Parabolic
Parabolic uptrend coming from daily move

#### Para MDR  
Parabolic move that didn't come from uptrend, sparked run out of nowhere

#### FBO (Failed Breakout)
Price sets high, fades for period, then retests high

#### D2
One day up, day two fade. Usually daily parabolics or big green day followed by big gap

#### MDR (Multi-Day Run)
D2 but two or more days up

#### Backside ET
Found after big move up and trend break, or in downtrend. Can be D2, MDR, or gap up

#### T30
Same as backside ET but coming off massive euphoric top/fade within 30-60 days

#### Uptrend ET
Uptrend move giving euphoric top, lacking parabolic speed up of daily parabolic

## The Indicator System

Systematic approach to seeing our language with custom indicators.

### Means - EMA System
**15m Chart:**
- 15m 50 EMA
- 15m 72/89 cloud  
- 15m 111 EMA
- 15m 222 EMA
- 30m 72/89 cloud
- 1hr 72/89

**Hourly Chart:**
- 1hr 72/89
- 2hr 72/89  
- 4hr 72/89

### Extremes - Deviation Bands
Two types based on 72/89 cloud:
1. **Main Deviation Band**: Setup and route start identification
2. **Execution Deviation Band**: Based on 9/20 cloud for entries

### Trail - 9/20 System
Used to see trail/trend when in actual trade. Helps when trend isn't clear.

### Supporting Indicators
- **VWAP**: Confirmation after entry, looking for adds
- **Volume**: Liquidity and confirmation moves
- **Previous Day Close**: Reference level
- **Historical Gap Stats**: For small cap day one setups

## Execution Framework

### Philosophy
Position trading approach:
- Get most position from route start
- Cover majority at route end  
- Take advantage of market structure in between
- Pyramid and build position, lowering stops

### Low Timeframe Execution
- Hit pops and cover dips
- Enter shorts in high part of trend
- Cover into low parts of trend
- Complete trade on trend breaks

### General Approach
- Enter shorts into deviation bands, high EV spots, trend breaks
- Cover at setup targets, extreme deviations, or trend breaks

## Systematic Setups

### Systematized (Documented)
- **OS D1**: Small cap day one gapper system
- **G2G S1**: Gap to go system  
- **SC DMR**: Small cap daily momentum reversal
- **SC MDR Swing**: Small cap multi-day run swing

### Non-Systematized (Ideas)
- Daily Para Run
- EXT Uptrend Gap
- Para FRD
- MDR
- LC FBO (Large cap failed breakout)
- LC T30 (Large cap top 30)
- LC Extended Trendbreak
- LC Breakdown
- Backside Trend Pop
- Backside Euphoric

## Key Concepts

### Trend Angle
- Steeper trend = focus on faster timeframe
- As trend angle increases, lower timeframe guides become more relevant

### In Play
- Liquid stocks with heightened volume and range
- Liquidity is critical - "when in doubt make sure it has fucking volume"

### High EV Spots
- Euphoric tops: Very high probability mean reversion
- Extreme deviations: Expect trend break or top
- Trend breaks: Transition points with gravity

## Business Strategy

### Current Model Flaws
1. Inability to handle scale and high frequency simultaneously
2. Low capture rate (actual return vs theoretical return)

### Solution: Full Algorithmic Approach
- Perfect capture rate minus slippage
- Handle infinite frequency  
- Trade any liquid asset worldwide
- Price action based on time and price candlesticks

### Goals
- Scale to $1M/month
- Build automated trading infrastructure
- Productize system for others
- Clone strategies efficiently

### Three Core Processes
1. **Edge Discovery**: Finding profitable patterns
2. **Strategy Building**: Systematizing approaches  
3. **Execution**: Automated trade management

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Data Sources
- **Primary**: Polygon.io for all market data
- **Backtesting**: backtesting.py engine
- **Technical Analysis**: TA-Lib for indicators

### MCP Integration
- All strategies integrate with MCP (Model-Controller-Processor) architecture
- Seamless connection between discretionary analysis and systematic execution
