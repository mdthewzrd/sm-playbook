# Lingua Trading Language - Complete Visual Guide

## Overview

Lingua is the comprehensive trading language and framework that forms the foundation of the SM Playbook trading system. This document combines the complete theoretical framework with visual examples to illustrate every concept.

> *"This language isn't meant to be the gospel on how the market works, rather a grouping of patterns and indicators to help us categorize the randomness unfolding in the market at all times."*

## Core Principle: Everything is Fractal

The fundamental concept of Lingua is that everything is fractal - the same patterns happen on each timeframe, they just happen at different times. This means our trading approach is seen in the foundation of everything we do.

## Trend Cycles

The baseline approach is the trend cycle. This cycle is how we see all trends at their stage level:

**Complete Cycle:**
```
Consolidation → Breakout/Trendbreak → Uptrend → Extreme Deviation → 
Euphoric Top/Trendbreak → Backside → Backside Reverted → 
Consolidation/Backside Breakout → Repeat
```

### Visual Chart Breakdown

This is a daily chart breakdown showing the complete trend cycle:

![Daily Chart Trend Cycle](../images/lingua%20image%201.png)
*Daily chart breakdown showing consolidation → breakout → uptrend → extreme deviation → euphoric top → trend break → backside → backside reverted*

Now look at the 4hr chart - notice how the same patterns appear on different timeframes:

*4hr chart showing fractal nature of trend cycles across timeframes*

Here's the hourly chart with detailed annotations showing how the trend cycle unfolds:

![Hourly Chart Annotation](../images/lingua%20image%203.png)
*Hourly chart with detailed trend cycle annotations and indicator interactions*

That entire move is made of this cycle over and over again. This is the trend cycle and the foundational framework of our strategy.

## Trend Cycle Trade Approaches

### In Consolidation
During initial consolidation, you're becoming aware of a name with some form of catalyst (both thesis - fundamental reason to go up beyond technicals).

![Consolidation Trading](../images/lingua%20image%204.png)
*Consolidation phase showing dips to means, extremes, and main breakout opportunities*

High EV spots:
- Dips to means or extremes
- Main breakouts
- Break and retest patterns
- Early trend breaks (great sizing spots)

### In Uptrend
After the breakout day, we've confirmed the move into uptrend. Only long-biased trades focusing on dips to means or extremes.

![Uptrend Phase](../images/lingua%20image%205.png)
*Uptrend phase showing systematic approach to long entries at means and extremes*

This uptrend stage continues until we reach extreme deviation levels.

## Euphoric Tops - High EV Opportunities

Euphoric tops represent one of our best short opportunities - the catalytic day when shorts begin to take control.

![Euphoric Top Concept](../images/lingua%20image%206.png)
*Simple illustration of euphoric top - the move outside the trend channel*

### Euphoric Top Examples

Here are real examples of different types of euphoric tops:

![Euphoric Example 1](../images/lingua%20image%207.png)
*Classic euphoric gap and fade pattern*

![Euphoric Example 2](../images/lingua%20image%208.png)
*Pre-market euphoric extension with retest*

![Euphoric Example 3](../images/lingua%20image%209.png)
*Post-open euphoric extension*

![Euphoric Example 4](../images/lingua%20image%2010.png)
*Partial euphoric with multiple attempts*

![Euphoric Example 5](../images/lingua%20image%2011.png)
*After-hours euphoric with morning retest*

![Euphoric Example 6](../images/lingua%20image%2012.png)
*Morning gap euphoric pattern*

![Euphoric Example 7](../images/lingua%20image%2013.png)
*Parabolic euphoric with speed-up characteristics*

## Trend Breaks - Transition Points

Trend breaks mark the crucial transition from frontside to backside - the point of no return.

![Trend Break Example 1](../images/lingua%20image%2014.png)
*Hourly trend break showing the main supporting trend*

![Trend Break Example 2](../images/lingua%20image%2015.png)
*Another trend break example showing the main MTF trend*

Notice how in the second example, even though the trend was steep and close to price, it was the main trend from the move up, making it the critical break.

![Trend Break Comparison](../images/lingua%20image%2016.png)
*Comparison showing main trend vs. secondary trend breaks*

### Trend Break Quality

The higher the trend break is in the trend's range, the better the trend break. This means higher likelihood of fading past the trend.

![High Range Trend Break](../images/lingua%20image%2017.png)
*High-quality trend break near the top of the range*

This is much better than a trend break that happens lower in the range:

![Low Range Trend Break](../images/lingua%20image%2018.png)
*Lower-quality trend break in the middle of the range*

**Key Point**: You want to see at least three touches on the trend, preferably three or more.

![Three Touch Rule](../images/lingua%20image%2019.png)
*Trend with three touches showing validity before break*

Sometimes euphoric tops work or don't, then you get the trend break after. Pay attention to how high in the range this trend break is happening:

![Sequential Pattern](../images/lingua%20image%2020.png)
*Euphoric top followed by high-range trend break*

## How Trends Interact - Stair Stepping

The stair stepping concept shows how trends interact across timeframes:

![Stair Stepping Example 1](../images/lingua%20image%2021.png)
*Chart showing 2hr and 4hr mean levels (blue clouds) and how price reacts*

![Stair Stepping Example 2](../images/lingua%20image%2022.png)
*Price going directly to 2hr mean before continuation*

![Stair Stepping Example 3](../images/lingua%20image%2023.png)
*Multiple timeframe interaction showing the stair-step process*

### Reset Concept

When price moves too far too fast, it creates "resets" requiring bigger bounces:

![Reset Concept](../images/lingua%20image%2024.png)
*Chart showing steep fade to 5m lower dev band requiring bigger reset*

The first move didn't hit the dev band, so the pop struggles:

![Weak Reset](../images/lingua%20image%2025.png)
*Weak reset when 5m dev band wasn't hit*

But when we hit the 5m main dev band lower, we need a bigger reset - going to the next timeframe up (15m):

![Strong Reset](../images/lingua%20image%2026.png)
*Strong reset after hitting 5m dev band, requiring 15m level*

The first drop also went into the 2m main dev band, requiring a 5m close dev band reset:

![2m Reset Example](../images/lingua%20image%2027.png)
*2m dev band hit requiring 5m reset - showing the complete cycle*

## Market Structure

Market structure and trend are the same thing. The dark blue trend shows the cycle, while light blue shows the structure forming the trend:

![Market Structure](../images/lingua%20image%2028.png)
*Visual representation of how market structure forms trends*

## Trend Angle

Trend angle affects which timeframe to focus on. Steeper angles require faster timeframes:

![Trend Angle Example](../images/lingua%20image%2029.png)
*Different trend angles showing speed variations*

When the angle increases, hourly guides become less effective than 15m guides:

![Trend Angle Application](../images/lingua%20image%2030.png)
*Chart showing how trend angle affects timeframe selection*

## Daily Context Categories

### Frontside vs Backside

Frontside means at all-time highs for this move:

![Frontside Example](../images/lingua%20image%2031.png)
*NVDA daily run - all frontside once over the high*

Backside means below a previous swing high:

![Backside Example](../images/lingua%20image%2032.png)
*Backside move with previous high resistance*

IPO context is straightforward:

![IPO Example](../images/lingua%20image%2033.png)
*IPO chart example*

## Daily Molds

### Daily Parabolic
Parabolic uptrend coming from a daily move:

![Daily Parabolic 1](../images/lingua%20image%2034.png)
*Daily parabolic example 1*

![Daily Parabolic 2](../images/lingua%20image%2035.png)
*Daily parabolic example 2*

### Para MDR
Parabolic move that didn't come from uptrend - sparked out of nowhere:

![Para MDR](../images/lingua%20image%2036.png)
*Para MDR - parabolic without preceding uptrend*

### FBO (Failed Breakout)
Price sets high, fades, then retests the high:

![FBO Example 1](../images/lingua%20image%2037.png)
*Classic FBO pattern*

![FBO Example 2](../images/lingua%20image%2038.png)
*Another FBO variation*

![FBO Example 3](../images/lingua%20image%2039.png)
*FBO with extended consolidation*

### D2 (Day Two)
One day up, day two fade:

![D2 Example 1](../images/lingua%20image%2040.png)
*Classic D2 pattern*

![D2 Example 2](../images/lingua%20image%2041.png)
*D2 with large gap*

### MDR (Multi-Day Run)
D2 but extended to multiple days:

![MDR Example 1](../images/lingua%20image%2042.png)
*MDR pattern showing multiple day progression*

![MDR Example 2](../images/lingua%20image%2043.png)
*Extended MDR example*

### Backside ET
Found after big moves up and trend breaks:

![Backside ET](../images/lingua%20image%2044.png)
*Backside ET pattern in downtrend context*

### T30
Same as backside ET but coming off massive euphoric top within 30-60 days:

![T30 Example 1](../images/lingua%20image%2045.png)
*T30 pattern close to euphoric top*

![T30 Example 2](../images/lingua%20image%2046.png)
*T30 with gap up into underwater longs*

![T30 Example 3](../images/lingua%20image%2047.png)
*T30 proximity to major euphoric fade*

### Uptrend ET
Uptrend move giving euphoric top without parabolic speed-up:

![Uptrend ET 1](../images/lingua%20image%2048.png)
*Uptrend ET - lacks parabolic characteristics*

![Uptrend ET 2](../images/lingua%20image%2049.png)
*Another uptrend ET example*

![Uptrend ET 3](../images/lingua%20image%2050.png)
*Uptrend ET with measured move characteristics*

![Uptrend ET 4](../images/lingua%20image%2051.png)
*Final uptrend ET example showing controlled ascent*

## Trend Walking

![Trend Walking](../images/lingua%20image%2052.png)
*Trend walking concept - indicators removed for clarity*

The concept shows how trends evolve and change as a stock moves. Starting at the trend beginning and drawing all trend lines until the inevitable break creates a ramp-like structure with multiple trends getting higher and faster.

## Indicators in Action

### Means - EMA Cloud System

![EMA Cloud Layout](../images/lingua%20image%2053.png)
*Complete EMA cloud system showing multiple timeframes*

The 15m cloud (primary) follows MTF trends best and provides the main mean reference.

### Extremes - Deviation Bands

Main deviation band parameters for setup identification:

![Main Dev Band Parameters](../images/lingua%20image%2054.png)
*Parameter settings for main deviation bands*

![Main Dev Band Chart](../images/lingua%20image%2055.png)
*Main deviation bands in action on chart*

Execution deviation band parameters (9/20 based):

![Execution Dev Band Parameters](../images/lingua%20image%2056.png)
*Parameter settings for execution deviation bands*

![Execution Dev Band Chart](../images/lingua%20image%2057.png)
*Execution deviation bands showing precise entry timing*

Note how the red upper band is excellent at picking tops in trends.

Long setup parameters (when needed):

![Long Setup Parameters](../images/lingua%20image%2058.png)
*Parameter adjustments for long setups*

![Long Setup Chart](../images/lingua%20image%2059.png)
*Long setup deviation bands in bullish context*

### Trail System

![Trail System](../images/lingua%20image%2060.png)
*9/20 trail system showing trend confirmation*

When we confirm and flip red, the trend ends as soon as we close outside the top of the red cloud on both days shown.

### Preferred Layout

![Preferred Layout](../images/lingua%20image%2061.png)
*Simplified layout with 2 dev bands, 2 EMA clouds, VWAP and PDC*

Notice how beautifully price interacts with means and extremes like clockwork.

## Execution Examples

### Hit Pops and Cover Dips

![Execution Example 1](../images/lingua%20image%2062.png)
*Example of hitting pops into deviation bands*

![Execution Example 2](../images/lingua%20image%2063.png)
*Example of covering dips at target levels*

![Execution Example 3](../images/lingua%20image%2064.png)
*Complete execution cycle showing entries and exits*

The general approach: enter shorts in high part of trend, cover into low parts, complete on trend breaks.
