- Implement semantic analysis and validation
- Generate executable strategy objects

### Sample Lingua Strategy
```lingua
strategy EMACloudStrategy {
  parameter fastPeriod = 9
  parameter slowPeriod = 20
  parameter riskPercent = 0.02
  
  indicator emaFast = EMA(close, fastPeriod)
  indicator emaSlow = EMA(close, slowPeriod)
  indicator atr = ATR(14)
  
  rule longEntry: emaFast > emaSlow AND emaFast[1] <= emaSlow[1] => 
    buy size calculateSize(riskPercent, atr)
    
  rule longExit: emaFast < emaSlow =>
    sell all
}
```

### Definition of Done
- [ ] Parser successfully handles sample strategies
- [ ] Syntax validation with helpful error messages

    const fastEMA = this.calculateEMA(data, config.fastPeriod);
    const slowEMA = this.calculateEMA(data, config.slowPeriod);
    
    return fastEMA.map((fast, i) => ({
      timestamp: data[i].timestamp,
      value: fast.value - slowEMA[i].value // Cloud difference
    }));
  }
}
```
