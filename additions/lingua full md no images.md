# Lingua

this is the grand guide to our trading language, the contents of this doc give a comprehensive breakdown of the ins and outs of our trend cycle trading language. this language isnt meant to be the gospel on how the market works, rather a grouping of patterns and indicators to help us categorize the randomness unfolding in the market at all times.

# Introduction

So the first concept I want you to grasp is that everything is fractal.  the  things are happening on each time frame they just happen at different times.  this means that our rough trading approach is  seen in the foundation of everything we do.

 the Baseline approach is the trend cycle.  this cycle is how we see all trends at their stage level.   
 this is the structure

# Trend Cycles

Consolidation → Breakout/Trendbreak → Uptrend → Extreme Deviation → Euphoric top/Trendbreak → Backside → Backside Reverted → Consolidation/Backside Breakout → Repeat

### Consolidation

Consolidation can go and time  and consolidation can also happen at many points on the chart, in the scenario where consolidation is the first step in our Trend cycle this is the main consolidation.. sometimes there isn't a clear consolidation and instead it is just a trend.  either way you were looking for the clear Trend that is forming from the high or the and the low

###  breakout/trend break

 this is the catalyst point of the consolidation when we are either breaking our trend or breaking out from the consolidation. sometimes it's a break and run other times a break and retest sometimes we even sit on the trend and consolidate before running but either way we see a break of whatever trender consolidation we've been held in

###  Uptrend

 once we have broken  a downtrend or broken out from a consolidation we are now in a uptrend   
The uptrend can be moving at various speeds the main thing we are looking at is Extreme deviations from the bottom and top of the Trenton Channel once we get to extreme points we move to the next stage

###  extreme deviation

 we are still in our uptrend at this point and it can actually go on for much more time Beyond this, but at this point in time we've now reached extreme points on our chart and this Alters how we want to be considering the  our  bias,  at this point you were starting to expect a trend break or  euphoric top

###  euphoric top

 a euphoric Gap doesn't happen on every extreme deviation but it does happen on a lot of them,  a euphoric Gap can show itself in many different ways you forgaps can be after hours runs, early pre-market gaps pre-market  parabolic,  morning Gap,  or even a post open extension  
The main things with the euphoric top is that this is the move outside of the trend normally it's signified by speed up where the trend ramps higher farther faster and on more volume,  euphoric tops normally happen as well when the trend has gotten very high in relation to the  range.  euphoric tops will be very clear once you see some annotated charts  
 this move is a very high probability mean reversion opportunity, a good chunk of them will just revert to the trend or the mean, and continue higher, other opportunities will lead into a trend break that same day and be big faders. This is referred to as a high EV spot this concept will be further expanded on later but it's important to note

###  Trend break

 this is the key point in the move, as this is when the uptrend officially turns to Backside  
 when looking at a chart in a uptrend the main Trend that is supporting the bottom of the channel is the key when that breaks the chart is on backside and there is gravity bringing it down

###   back side

 in backside we are reverting to a higher time frame mean, backside is an indefinite time and the approach to trading in backside is unique to its context

###  backside reverted

 whenever something hits its higher time frame mean and by higher time frame I don't mean higher as in the HTF we will classify later I mean higher as in the time frame longer than whatever Trend you were currently following doing the trend cycle on, this will also be clarified shortly

###  consolidation/backside Breakout

 once we have reverted backside can continue to consolidate going up and down and also having breakout moves this continues until you see your major frontside Breakout, this isn't necessarily once you are at new all time highs, but you are breaking the clear highest time frame trend that is the entire downward resistance of the backside, and just like before this doesn't have to be a consolidation it can also be a trend break

 and now the cycle repeats itself as we have just broken out from our main trend and we can begin uptrend again

All right so that's our main Baseline, now let's start to make some real sense of this

### Chart Breakdown

This is a daily chart breakdown  
Lingua image 1

Now look at the 4hr, im not going to annotate this one but see the trends  
lingua image 2

Instead ill annotate the hourly on this run  
lingua image 3

That entire move is made of this cycle over and over again

This is the trend cycle and the foundational framework of our strategy, as you notice these charts are loaded with indicators, we will dive in detail on these indicators and how we use them, for now just think of them as our language’s systematic approach to seeing the trend cycle and various spots we want to do business in on the charts

## Timeframes

To continue lets talk about our timeframes

### Our main tf set

Daily, 4hr, 1h, 15m, 5m ,2m, and 1m

To make things more simple we really just focus on these tf, but withThat in mind are processes fractal and all time frames provide value

###  the bias process

 at the end of the day we are using this process to try and get a better understanding of what biases we should expect to see play out in the market  
 to create a bias we simplify the trend cycle process to look at three groupings  
HTF, MTF, and LTF  
 this is our high time frame low time frame and middle time frame  
 the daily and 4 Hour make our HTF  
 the hourly and 15 minute make our MTF  
 and the 5 minute and 2 minute make our LTF

### Rough trading guide

 when it comes to our actual trades the majority of them are intraday trades, on these the groupings serve these rough purposes  
HTF \-  this is where we find our setup, determine our main bias, and determine our most key levels  
MTF \-  this is where we see are high  odd route start and Route end for the bigger picture trade start and endpoint,  as well this time frame is normally where we see our main Trend break  
LTF \-  this is where we see our execution spots, in between the start and end of the trade the ltf gives us spots to be entering and managing our trades

### TF Strength

 when it comes to time frames although they are all fractal there is a general  chain of command, where the highest time frames Normally play the biggest role in the direction and the rankings go from highest down

This also means that between our htf MTF and ltf the Order of  strength is top down

 what this “ chain of command”  or “ strength”   means is the weight or Focus you want to put on a time frame.   
  that is in general, what happens when you're more specific  
 when you are looking for answers to specific questions this affects what time frames deserve the most Focus

 for example if I'm looking for the route start and Route end on my trade then I should be prioritizing our MTF as that is where we find that part of the trade.  
 where do I enter my add to this trade shouldn't be answered on the hourly chart  
 different questions are answered on different time frames

 in our main intraday trading approach  the rule of thumb is that you could find your setups  and some of your bigger picture targets on HTF. the route start route end as well as the main reset in the trade, and even the main area where we see our trends and deviations is the MTF. and then all of our execution goes down on the 2-minute chart, execution is tied in with all the charts as you are entering on specific spots on other charts, but we use the 2 minute to actually fill and confirm entries the  ltf is our execution hub

 as well none of this is perfect so there is some bleed over sometimes the 5-minute helps you with your route start and other times the hourly helps you with your setup and high time frame

## Trend cycle trade approaches

So when it comes to trading inside of the trend cycle this is a general rule of thumb  
 we are mostly talking here on our three highest time frames  Daily 4 Hour and hourly.

###  In consolidation

 during this initial consolidation you are likely becoming aware of a name with some form of both thesis ( but both thesis is essentially a reason to go up something Beyond just the technicals like looming news and election forward-looking event earnings Etc, something to make the chart go up and make this break out that is pending work)  
  in theory you aren't looking much for trades here outside of the main breakout that you were looking to get long.  
 high EV spots and areas to be looking to enter would be dips to the means or extremes and the main Breakout  plus any break and retest would be your main entry and sizing spot   
In this stage you can also see  early Trend breaks prior to the main Breakout these are also great sizing spots and the early confirmations on the looming move and Stage change   
lingua image 4

### In uptrend

After the day of the Breakout we have confirmed moved into uptrend, when you are an uptrend we really only want to be looking for a long biased trades two  trade types that we are looking for is dips to the means or extremes   
This uptrend stage continues until we begin to trade into extreme levels, entering extreme deviation  
lingua image 5

### Extreme Deviation

At this point in the trade once we have reached extreme deviation you do not want to be looking for Longs anymore, as the trend can flip at any point. at this point in time we are just looking for you for it top shorts or Trend brake shorts  
 extreme deviation is the most discretionary part of this process  
 the indicators we use are going to be the main guide, and in general  our scans are showing us names and extreme deviation for  our mean reversion setup to help reduce some of the noise

 things like the one hour for our and daily deviation band  upper is a good guide  
 as well looking at the extension from various EMAs on the daily chart 

As a whole it is okay to be earlier with this stage verse later, as the big aspect is that you want to stop looking for long trades, all of our short trades will come as either euphoric top or Trend break so they are in the next stage regardless 

### Euphoric Top

Is one  of our best short opportunities, this is the catalytic day in the uptrend wear shorts begin to take control again   
This stage in simple terms is the move into/outside of the top of the trend Channel   
lingua image 6  
This is a simple illustration of the rough outline.  
 in general with euphoric pops we are really only trading them from 7:00 a.m. to latest 12:00 p.m.,  for the most part it's a very open Centric setup  
 there are a few types of euphoric tops that we look for  
 euphoric Gap  
 euphoric EXT  
Partial euphoric  
One point to note with euphoric apps is that they could have a euphoric extension in after hours and then give a retest near the highs in pre-market or after the open this is still euphoric top

 another point that I will better clarify later on is that certain setups  can have different euphoric tops other than these

Here are some examples of euphoric tops  
lingua image 7

lingua image 8

lingua image 9

lingua image 10

lingua image 11

lingua image 12

lingua image 13

### Trendbreak

Is a very crucial part of our Trend cycle, the trend break is when we transition from front side to back side, it's the point of no return for the trend.  
 sometimes Trend breaks happen on the same day as the euphoric top,  those are normally our A+ opportunities as it tends to happen on very extreme mean reversion moves  
 for the most part I like to use the hourly chart to draw trends  
 the main role of thumb is that we want the main MTF trend,  this should be the trend that is supporting this entire upward leg.   
lingua image 14

lingua image 15

Notice on how the example above its the main tb even tho it was super steep and close to price, like the early trend break in the first example, this is because on the first, that wasnt the main trend from the move up, where on the second, it is. Meaning its the main trend  
lingua image 16

#### Trendbreak note

One One concept that I want to establish when it comes to Trends and trend breaks, is that the higher the trend break is in the trends range the better the trend break. I say better as in the more likeliness that it will lead to a fade past the trend

Something like this  
lingua image 17

Is way higher in the range than this  
lingua image 18

Another thing too is that You really want to see three touches on the trend, it's okay if it's too but ideally you want three  
lingua image 19

Sometimes euphoric tops work or dont then you get the tb after, pay attention to how high we are in the range of this uptrend, that trendbreak is happening just below highs  
lingua image 20

### Backside

 once we are in backside for the most part we are just looking for shorts until we reach our main reversion point, we really don't want to be longing during this time as a tie odds for fading. We look for the same euphoric tops, but there is also a lot of value with price going to the means, just like an uptrend how we want to be longing the means or extremes, in backside or “downtrend”  we want to be shorting the means or the extremes

 in backside you need to be wary of your hourly 4 Hour and daily target areas, or the deviation bands to the downside, this is because we need to keep in mind where we are in the bigger picture range. once we reach that mean area we don't really want to be aggressively shorting anymore or even aggressively longing because nobody knows where this thing is going to go

### Backside Reverted

 once we are in backside reverted, this is somewhat similar to the consolidation approach, but we do have some trading opportunities. for the most part we want to have a short biased as the  chart is still on back side and we don't want to be as aggressive with shorting the means anymore.  the general rule of thumb is  euphoric setups in either direction, or very clear quality Trend breaks are good opportunities in this cycle

## How Trends interact

 so now I want to dive into a point that might be hard to grasp but is very important inside of our process. and this is the way in which Trends react to one another  
 as we already established we are trending on all time frames and for the most part the higher time frames hold more weight  
 but there is a phenomenon that I've noticed called the stair stepping of trends.   day to day I'm mostly using this concept on the low time frame execution,  but this is applicable to all parts of our process and should also give you good insight to see how everything is all a part of the same unified theory

The first application of this idea can be applied to the main Trend break,  when we break say our hourly trend where are we going to? and now down is a good answer, but the real answer is the 2 or 4-Hour mean. I mostly just use the 4hr to keep things simple, but the answer is the next higher timeframe

In these charts, the 2 blue clouds are the 2hr and 4hr mean, these are just indicators and guides, as its not exact but this is one of the ways we roughly see the means or get a guage of the zone they are in  
As you see in this chart, we went right to the 2hr mean before going higher  
lingua image 21

lingua image 22

lingua image 23

Another application of this is a concept we call resets when price goes too far down too fast   
lingua image 24

Take this chart, we fade to our main 5m lower dev band, this is a steep move quickly, signifying a bounce, but we went all the way to our 5m lower dev band  
In the first move down we dont hit that dev band, and as you see, that pop struggles to even get to our closer 5m upper dev band  
lingua image 25

The difference, is the 5m main db lower hit, this means we need a bigger reset. So we go one timeframe up, instead of the 5m close db upper as the reset point, now its the 15m… and as you see  
lingua image 26  
 well what does this mean with that first drop then   
lingua image 27

It went well into our 2m main db so now we want a 5m close db reset

As you see its all a cycle

Market Structure  
The dark blue trend is where we see the cycle, the light blue is the market structure that forms the trend  
lingua image 28

 in General market structure and Trend are actually the same thing,  and the use of our language we use Market structure to actually execute and enter and exit the trades that we find on the bigger picture Trend cycle  
At its core, Market structure is literally just Trends sequences of higher highs and higher lows and then when they break it causes sequences of lower lows and lower highs.  the pivots or structure points are very key as this is how we draw our trends, find risk levels, and also see the transforming in real time

## Trend Angle

Another concept that i want to establish is trend angle  
So Trend angle is a concept that is still pretty discretionary as I haven't found the full method of applying it to my process, but I do use this idea as a guide. so Trend angle is exactly what it sounds it's what angle is this trend going up at   
lingua image 29

 how this concept actually helps us, is in general the steeper a trend is the faster time frame you want to be focusing on

 if something is trending and respecting its hourly chart but then the trend angle really starts to increase, the  hourly guides we use are not as good as the 15 minute guides in this scenario as we are speeding up and increasing our Trend angle.  this was actually clear as day on one of the examples that I've sent over and over again in this document   
When the angle is lower earlier in the trend, the deb bands on the hourly is a great guide, where then those last two uptrends, we are radically speeding up, this hourly trend isnt as “in play” as the 15m in this scenario  
lingua image 30

## In play

Because I just brought up the word I want to quickly explain what in play is. in play it's just the term we use to describe liquid stocks that are trading heightened volume and heightened range. one of the most important parts of our entire Playbook is liquidity, we need liquidity and a lot of our trades are happening on some of the highest relative traded assets in the Market Per their normal averages.  we do not want to be trading setups that are lacking liquidity as we can't really trust the charts as much in those scenarios. when in doubt make sure it has fucking volume

## Daily Context

Another area that's worth talking about in these early stages is daily context as this is key to our approach to looking at setups  
 the simple point is that hundreds of different charts can be up trending or an extreme deviation or giving a euphoric top.. daily context  is how we differentiate between the various ways that opportunities set up

### Categories

 so the daily context is mostly a visual process for us right now but at its core there are three main categories. front side, backside, IPO.  every one of our daily contexts will fall into one of these three categories  
 front side is simply at all-time highs in this move, below side is simply not all time highs as there is a previous swing High we are trading below,   and IPO is IPO we all know what that means

 in general you want to be looking back like   
 years when determining if something is front side or not   
lingua image 31  
This daily run on nvda was all on frontside once we were over that high  
lingua image 32

This is an example of a backside move where we have a previous high we are below  
Ipo in case ur dumb   
lingua image 33

 so these are our main three categories,  now when it comes to the actual daily molds and how we classify them further we have a couple different types

### Daily Molds

 daily parabolic \-  this is a parabolic uptrend that is coming from a daily move  
lingua image 34

lingua image 35

 Para MDR \-  this is a parabolic move that didn't necessarily come from an uptrend, normally it just looks like a few candles that sparked this run out of nowhere  
lingua image 36

 FBO \-  this is when Price sets some form of high, then Fades off for a short period of time could be a few days few weeks few months Etc, then we run into that high retesting it  
lingua image 37  
lingua image 38

lingua image 39

D2 \-  this is a move that is one day up and then day two is a fade, most of these are daily parabolics or come from really big green days on day one followed by a really big gap.  for the most part these setups don't have anything going on before  the Big Green Day, but they can happen on trends  
lingua image 40  
lingua image 41

 MDR \-  this is basically a d2  just  two or more days up   
lingua image 42

lingua image 43

Backside ET \-  these are normally found after a big move up and the trend break, or in a asset that is stuck in a downtrend, these are sometimes d2s,  sometimes MDR,  and sometimes even just a gap up  
lingua image 44  
 T30 \-  this is basically the same thing as a backside et, the only difference is that it is coming off of a massive euphoric top/fade,   and it is also happening in close proximity ( 30-60 days)  
 this move again could be d2, mdr, or even just a gap up but we are trading into all the Longs that are now underwater  
lingua image 45

lingua image 46

lingua image 47

Uptrend ET \-  this is an uptrend move that  gives you euphoric top, this is lacking that parabolic speed up that we see in the daily parabolic   
lingua image 48

lingua image 49

lingua image 50

lingua image 51

## Trend walking

lingua image 52  
removed indicators to make it clean, the concept of trend walking is the idea that the trend is changing as a stock continues to move in a certain direction. this idea of walking the trend is starting at the start of the trend and drawing all the trend lines until the inevitable Trend break

 when doing this with an uptrend it should look like a ramp, and as you see with the trends in the subtrend we formed multiple different trends getting higher and faster as we go on.

## Indicators

In an attempt to better systematize our process and to give the language more “words” to work with we've built a system of indicators to help  see our language.  this is our main guide that we use to determine Trend Cycles as well as execution points

- ### Means 

   so the first indicator I want to talk about is one that helps us find Means, this is our set of EMAs that we use  
  15m chart  
   15m 50 EMA  
  15m 72/89 cloud  
  15m 111eme  
  15m 222ema  
  30m 72/89 cloud  
  1hr 72/89  
    
  Hourly chart  
  1hr 72/89  
  2hr 72/89  
  4hr 72/89  
    
  This is what the indicators look like   
  lingua image 53  
    
  It's meant to be a wide net, for the most part the 15 minute cloud is normally the main one we focus on when calling it a mean as you see in the chart it's the one that follows the closer MTF Trends the best  
    
   this is the code for the cloud   
  //**@version=**4  
  study("RahulLines Cloud", overlay\=true)  
    
  sl \= input(72, "Smaller length")  
  hl \= input(89, "Higher length")

  enable515 \= input(false,"5/15 EMA")  
  res2 \= input(title\="5 /15 EMA", type\=input.resolution, defval\="5")  
    
  tickprice1 \= security(syminfo.tickerid, res, close)  
  tickprice2 \= security(syminfo.tickerid, res, close)  
    
    
  ema1\_72 \= security(syminfo.tickerid, res,ema(close,sl))  
  ema1\_89 \= security(syminfo.tickerid, res,ema(close,hl))  
  ema2\_72 \= security(syminfo.tickerid, res1,ema(close,sl))  
  ema2\_89 \= security(syminfo.tickerid, res1,ema(close,hl))  
    
    
  ema3\_5 \= security(syminfo.tickerid, res2,ema(close,5))  
  ema3\_15 \= security(syminfo.tickerid, res2,ema(close,15))

  fill(p3\_1, p3\_2, color\=enable515?ema3\_5\>ema3\_15?color.blue:color.red:na,transp\=50,title\="Lade Day Fade ")   
    
  dl \= input(true, title\="Show daily Open")  
    
    
  dopen \= security(syminfo.tickerid, "D", open, lookahead\=barmerge.lookahead\_on)  
  plot(dl and dopen ? dopen : na, title\="Day open", color\=\#FF9800, style\=plot.style\_circles, linewidth \= 2, transp\=0)


- ### Extremes

  To our extreme deviations  we use an indicator that's actually based off the means.  it's a deviation band that plots based off whatever time frame you are ons 72/89 cloud  
    
   we use two different types of this indicator on our charts. the first is for the actual setup and Route start, this is our main deviation band   
  lingua image 54


   these are our parameters for it and also what it looks like 

  lingua image 55


   now the second version of the deviation band is used for execution, this one is based on our 9/20 Cloud which I will explain in the next indicator

   but yeah we use this indicator mostly for entries and finding the spots we want to see a stock pull back to to enter, as well we do use it at 's to help with cover spots 

  These are our params

  lingua image 56


  And as you see in this image, specifically the red upper band is really really good at picking the tops in the trend

  lingua image 57


  

  Now one point to note with this indicator, we mostly use this for entering. so this is actually the short-based version of the indicator. although I don't normally trade many longs, I want to showcase the long version as our full Playbook will have lots of long setups in it 


  This is the params

  lingua image 58


  And this is what it looks like

  lingua image 59


  

  The code 

  //**@version=**5

  indicator("Dual Deviation Cloud", overlay\=true)


  // User Inputs

  deviationAbove1 \= input.float(10.0, "First Positive Deviation Multiplier")

  deviationAbove2 \= input.float(8.0, "Second Positive Deviation Multiplier")

  deviationBelow1 \= input.float(10.0, "First Negative Deviation Multiplier")

  deviationBelow2 \= input.float(8.0, "Second Negative Deviation Multiplier")

  length72EMA \= input.int(72, "Length for the 72 EMA")

  length89EMA \= input.int(89, "Length for the 89 EMA")


  // Colors for the clouds

  colorAbove \= color.new(color.red, 60)

  colorBelow \= color.new(color.green, 60)


  // Calculate EMAs

  ema72 \= ta.ema(close, length72EMA)

  ema89 \= ta.ema(close, length89EMA)


  // Correct ATR calculation

  atr72 \= ta.sma(ta.tr(true), length72EMA)

  atr89 \= ta.sma(ta.tr(true), length89EMA)


  // Deviation lines

  deviationAboveLine1 \= ema72 \+ (deviationAbove1 \* atr72)

  deviationAboveLine2 \= ema72 \+ (deviationAbove2 \* atr72)

  deviationBelowLine1 \= ema89 \- (deviationBelow1 \* atr89)

  deviationBelowLine2 \= ema89 \- (deviationBelow2 \* atr89)


  // Plot the clouds

  plot(deviationAboveLine1, color\=colorAbove, title\="Deviation Above Line 1")

  plot(deviationAboveLine2, color\=colorAbove, title\="Deviation Above Line 2")

  plot(deviationBelowLine1, color\=colorBelow, title\="Deviation Below Line 1")

  plot(deviationBelowLine2, color\=colorBelow, title\="Deviation Below Line 2")


  fill(plot1\=plot(deviationAboveLine1, display\=display.none),

      plot2\=plot(deviationAboveLine2, display\=display.none),

      color\=colorAbove)


  fill(plot1\=plot(deviationBelowLine1, display\=display.none),

      plot2\=plot(deviationBelowLine2, display\=display.none),

      color\=colorBelow)


- ### Trail

  For this indicator we actually just use the first one but we changed the parameters around, instead of using the 72/89 now we use the 9/20  
   this indicator is mostly used to help us try and see the trail / Trend when we are in a actual trade.  for the most part we draw the trends but this is a Rough Guide to help us when the trend is an ass clear

  As you see on this chart once we confirm and flip red the trend ends as soon as we close outside the top of the red Cloud  on both days Shown,  that's how we use the trail


- ### Other

-  another indicator we use as a simple guide and Confirmation  is VWAP  we mostly just use it as a confirmation after we enter the trade to start looking for ads to our position.  
   	we just use a standard vwap  
    
-  another one we use is volume to help us See liquidity And Confirmation moves   
- And one final indicator we use on our charts is previous day closed  
-  also with our small cap day one setup we use historical Gap stats as well 

- ### My preference

  I like using a simplified version of the layout with the 2 dev bands, 2 ema clouds, vwap and pdc. Then i keep the second cloud and the 9/20 cloud on standby if i need it

  And as you see when looking at this layout look how beautifully price interacts with the means and extremes like fucking Clockwork  
  


## Execution Style And Approach

 so when it comes to execution Style, the timing that we are looking for with the trade is based on the setup, but in general are execution approach is the same across all opportunity types. I'm going to showcase our execution Style with short-based setups, the simple rule of thumb is that  we just do the opposite when we are longing.

This is the general philosophy of how we execute trades. Each setup will have its own ideal execution breakdowns shown in detail later.

 so our trade Style is based mostly around position Trading, looking to get most of our position from the route start, and then looking to cover the majority at the route end.

In between the route start and Route and we are looking to take advantage of the market structure in between, as I established earlier we normally find our route start and Route ends on the MTF. so when I talk about this in between Market structure Trading this is more using the ltf  
 during this part of the trade we are looking to recycle and for the most part we are looking to Pyramid here and build our possession lowering our stop and entering more shares to increase our risk to reward

 this low time frame execution could be simply described as hitting pops and covering dips

Simple hitting pops into dev bands, high ev spots and trendbreaks, covering setup targets, extreme deviations, or trendbreaks

The setups may have differences to them but the general rule of thumb and approach is the same we want to be entering shorts in the high part of the trend and covering into the low parts of the trend and then our completion of the trade is one of the trend breaks

## Business plan

So right now with my Trading and my overall business plan I see the opportunity to systematize everything. I see two foundational flaws in the trading business model when you do normal discretionary manual Trading 1\.  is the inability to handle scale and a high frequency of opportunities at the same time and still execute at a consistent high level 2\.  the capture rate which is how much of your Edge you actually get on a single trade with your manual execution if your strategy says you make 3r  but you only made 2r then your capture rate is 66%.  so these two things make it extremely hard to scale this business radically. on top of all that with my personality I like when things are backed by data and I have signals and automations to help give me bumpers to not fuck shit up.

 so game plan is to go full algorithmic with everything this way the capture rate is what I actually get on trades minus slippage, and I can handle infinite frequency. as my entire goal over the last 4 years has been to build a trading strategy that works specifically on time and price Candlestick charts. it doesn't matter the asset it is just simply trading price action and that is what this entire lingua is. so with that being said we have the opportunity to make money on basically any liquid asset in the world.  so that's why we are here building this as I need a team of Agents to help me build all of the strategies and algorithms. and in general to help me with automating the three processes of my business…  Edge discovery,  strategy building,  execution

 the goal is to scale to 1m  a month   
 but in terms of how we will get there, the first step is building out everything on the established setups and set up ideas listed above. I have a lot more ideas, there are tons of documents and strategies online, and the AI team itself will be able to come up with strategies so once we finish our main current existing Playbook we will move into the second phase of scaling out the fleet of algorithms

 and as we scale the fleet of algorithms we will also be building the long-term Playbook and the wealth generation Playbook which will not only be used for myself but also be productized and potentially sold to other people this entire infrastructure is a gold mine but I want to mostly use it to build my own automated trading infrastructure first

 I'd really like to be able to also clone people strategies and ideas very efficiently with this tool
